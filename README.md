# CS360-Server-Development
In developing the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I prioritized writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code by using a clear structure and comprehensive documentation. The CRUD Python module from Project One exemplified this approach, as I created well-defined classes and methods with descriptive names, allowing for easy future modifications. My problem-solving approach involved breaking down the project into manageable components, thoroughly understanding client requirements, and ensuring seamless integration of the dashboard with the MongoDB database. This differed from previous assignments, where the scope was often simpler; here, I had to consider complex interactions between multiple systems. Moving forward, I plan to gather detailed requirements, create flowcharts for data flow, and utilize prototyping in future projects. The work of computer scientists is crucial because it provides effective solutions to complex problems, streamlines processes, and enhances overall efficiency. By developing user-friendly applications and robust databases, we empower organizations to make informed decisions and optimize their operations.
